# AI Projects Showcasing Prompt Engineering Expertise

### Specialization Completed on July 19, 2024

I recently completed a specialization in prompt engineering from Coursera in collaboration with Vanderbilt University, taught by  Jules White. This course taught me how to convert thoughts into effective prompts that yield the necessary output from AI models. 

Upon completing this specialization, I developed expertise in prompt engineering for generative AI systems like ChatGPT. Through hands-on practice, I became proficient in instructing large language models to accomplish useful tasks. The specialization provided me with principles and templates for writing effective prompts that tap into the capabilities of systems like ChatGPT. I gained skills for conversing with AI to harness its reasoning and creative potential. Whether automating repetitive work, solving complex problems, or boosting productivity, I acquired techniques to integrate generative AI into various activities. This specialization equipped me with the core competencies needed to amplify human intelligence with prompt engineering.
