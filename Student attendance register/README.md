# Student Attendance Register

## Project Description
The Student Attendance Register App is an interactive web application where users can select numbered boxes from a grid, copy the selected numbers, and reset the selections. The app features smooth transitions, hover effects, and is designed with a mobile-friendly layout. The boxes are labeled from 1 to 70, L1 to L9, Y1, and B1 to B5. 

**Note**: "Made by Rudra (F23-48)" is displayed at the bottom of the app.


## Real-World Problem ( Why did I make this? )
During my college days, after each class, the student who was the class monitor would stand and call the roll number of each student from start to end, recording it on a piece of paper. This method was inefficient and ineffective, so I decided to use my prompt engineering skills to solve this real-world problem.

I wrote the initial prompt on the bus while traveling from college to home. After my online class finished, I began designing the Figma layout to define how the app should look and feel. Then, I started prototyping various versions, identifying bugs and errors in our app. After that, I refined the prompts according to the requirements. You can check out the prompt file to see the process. Here is the final result, as shown in the screenshot.

## How it looks finally
